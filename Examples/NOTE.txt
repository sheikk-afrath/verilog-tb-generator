How to run these examples:

1. Basic Adder (Works in Perl & Python):
   python ../python/gen_tb.py full_adder.v

2. 4-Bit Counter (Works in Perl & Python):
   python ../python/gen_tb.py counter_4bit.v
   (Tip: To better visualize the counting sequence, consider increasing the `delay` variable 
   in 'gen_tb.py' (e.g., to 50 or 100). This allows the counter to increment for multiple 
   clock cycles between random input changes.)

3. Advanced Vector Demo (PYTHON ONLY):
   python ../python/gen_tb.py python_demo.v
   (Note: The Perl script will fail on the [0:7] vector declaration)
